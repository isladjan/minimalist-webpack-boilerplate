# ðŸ“¦ Minimalist Webpack 5 Boilerplate

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Minimalist webpack 5 setup using PostCSS

## Features

    - Separate webpack configurations for each environment (common, dev, prod and analyzer)

    - This Setup is only configured to copy assets files (images, fonts...) to the dist folder. Literally the entire contents of the Static folder are copied. The path for External resources (from the Static folder) that you specify in html, css and js must be specified as relative to the dist folder

Javascript

        - Production mode: js minify, tree shaking, remove comments
        - Development mode: source map, Live Server
        - Both: default Bundle splitting (all npm scripts in one vendor.js file, all my .js files in one bundle, asynchronous modules each in its own bundle)

CSS

        css-loader                      //allows Wabpack handling .css files
        css-minimizer-webpack-plugin    //minify css
        mini-css-extract-plugin         //final css bundled file inserts into <head>
        postcss-loader  & postcss       //enable PostCSS
        postcss-preset-env              //autoprefixer &  transform new css properties that are not supported in some browsers (specified in BroswerList) into fallbacks

        - all css files will be bundled into one separate file and added to <head>
        - external resources from the .css file Webpack will not resolve (you specify the path as from the dist folder)
        - production phase: css code will be minified & transform new css properties that are not supported in some browsers (specified in BroswerList) into fallbacks
        - normalize is not set
